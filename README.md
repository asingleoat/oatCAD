enter the nix-shell, direnv works and while working alone I'm tracking my .envrc

start the zig server; either:
`./hot-run.sh` if you want to write code with hot-reload
or just `zig build run` if you want to run one-off

then open the render client in a browser by:
`file:///home/<path-to-repo>/oatCAD/babylon.html`
